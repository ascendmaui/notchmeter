/// One actor type serves two rows since 0.9.0: Gemini CLI's (`tool: .gemini`) and Antigravity's

/// installed; now each row reads under its own product's identity, so each shows its own figures, and a Mac with
/// both reads both. Gemini CLI's row is installed wherever its login is (`oauth_creds.json`), and asks with Gemini
/// CLI's identity on the two hosts in turn; Antigravity's row is installed wherever the app, its home folder or its
/// CLI's folder is, and asks with Antigravity's identity on the host its CLI logged. Both use the one login on
/// disk, Gemini CLI's, because the Antigravity app and `agy` keep theirs in the Keychain; the backend picks the
/// licence it checks from the identity, so the two rows can rightly disagree.
///
/// Gemini CLI and Antigravity meter against the same Google Code Assist backend, and Gemini CLI caches its Google
/// login in `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json` (`Storage.getOAuthCredsPath` in gemini-cli packages/core/src/config/storage.ts),
/// a google-auth-library `Credentials` object: `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `scope`, `token_type`, `id_token` and
/// `expiry_date` in epoch milliseconds, written with mode 0600 by `cacheCredentials` in code_assist/oauth2.ts. That
/// token is used, never refreshed or written, for the two reads Gemini CLI itself makes against
/// `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal` (CODE_ASSIST_ENDPOINT and CODE_ASSIST_API_VERSION in
/// code_assist/server.ts), each a POST with `Content-Type: application/json` and the Bearer token:
///
/// 1. `:loadCodeAssist` with `{"metadata":{"ideType":"GEMINI_CLI","platform":"PLATFORM_UNSPECIFIED","pluginType":"GEMINI"}}`
///    (LoadCodeAssistRequest in code_assist/types.ts; GEMINI_CLI is one of its ClientMetadataIdeType values). The
///    answer carries `cloudaicompanionProject`, the project the quota is metered on; `currentTier` with an `id` of
///    free-tier, legacy-tier or standard-tier and a `name`; an optional `paidTier.name`; and, since June 2026,
///    `ineligibleTiers[].reasonCode == "UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT"` for the personal accounts Google no longer serves here.
/// 2. `:retrieveUserQuota` with `{"project":"<cloudaicompanionProject>"}` (RetrieveUserQuotaRequest; Gemini CLI's
///    `Config.refreshUserQuota` in config/config.ts sends exactly this). The answer is `{"buckets":[BucketInfo]}` with
///    `modelId`, `remainingFraction` (0...1 of the quota left), `resetTime` (RFC 3339) and, optionally,
///    `remainingAmount` (a count, as a string) and `tokenType`. No window length is declared, so a window here has no
///    pace tick or projection until Google publishes one. A personal account gets HTTP 403 with the ErrorInfo reason
///    `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED`: the shutdown, which is documented as permanent, so it is reported as a calm state
///    (`ProviderError.notServed`) rather than a fault. The row reads idle with the sentence as its note, hides under
///    *Hide assistants with nothing to show*, and is asked again about once an hour rather than every five minutes.
///    That matters most for the Antigravity user base, personal Google AI Pro accounts, whose Gemini CLI row would
///    otherwise fail on both hosts at every poll for an answer that is not going to change.
///
/// Buckets are grouped the way Gemini CLI's own /stats view groups them (ui/components/ModelQuotaDisplay.tsx): the
/// Gemini models of one tier (Pro, Flash, Flash Lite) share a pool, so a tier is one window at its lowest remaining
/// fraction; every other model is a window of its own.
///
/// Since September 2026 (docs/accuracy.md, *Antigravity*) three more things are true of these two calls:
///
/// - An Antigravity licence is held by the user, not a project. The project-scoped quota call answers 403 "You do
///   not have a valid license of this product" for an Antigravity-only account while the same call with `{}`
///   answers, and the backend picks which product's licence to check from the caller's identity, so the
///   Antigravity row's calls carry `User-Agent: antigravity`, a `Client-Metadata` naming the IDE, and
///   `ideType: ANTIGRAVITY`; the Gemini CLI row keeps Gemini CLI's own identity, above.
/// - `:retrieveUserQuotaSummary` (`{}`) is the richer answer, the session and weekly groups Antigravity's own
///   panel shows, with a declared window length; it is asked first and the per-model buckets are the fallback.
/// - The quota is metered on one of two deployments, `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` and
///   `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com`, and the other one answers every bucket untouched with a reset five hours
///   from the moment it was asked, whatever has been used (antigravity-cli #387). The Antigravity row prefers the
///   host Antigravity's own CLI logged; failing that, and always for the Gemini CLI row, whose calls that log says
///   nothing about, both are tried and the first with a live figure is believed. A payload
///   whose every bucket reads untouched with one identical reset is written down as unmetered rather than as a
///   100 % ring, a bucket with no fraction is a window with no figure rather than a skipped one, and a fraction of
///   exactly 0 is exhausted.
